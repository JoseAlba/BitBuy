			<h1>Meet Jose Alba</h1>
			<p>My Fall 2016 semester was the most difficult, stress inducing semester yet, not only because of my academics but because of all the personal projects I began working on. I also did some other valuable activities such as competing in a programming competition, networking, interviews, and trading. All of these activities combined with school it made it almost impossible to manage, but I continued to persevere and stay dedicated to achieving my goals and was able to overcome these challenges.
				<br><br>
				My Winter semester, on the other hand, was the most enjoyable time of my life. My six months in Europe went by so quickly, and I still can’t believe it’s over already! Student exchange has been the best experience of my life, but it has also been an eye opening experience. I traveled to fifteen countries during my trip and experienced their unique cultures and lifestyles. I have walked on yellow, white, red, and even black sand all across Europe and even had the opportunity to see a volcano erupt in the middle of Mediterranean Sea – something only a lucky few witness in their lifetime. I partied in Ibiza while staying in an extravagant mansion with friends from all around the world. I also backpacked by the Italian coastline where I would sleep in benches, tables, and even the beach, which was so rewarding! I did a road trip with my best friend where we would sleep in the car and eat tomatoes for dinner. I jumped from cliffs in Cinque Terre that could have potentially destroyed my life. I witnessed the longest jager-bomb train in the world, went into the baths of Hungary, tried water hover boarding in Greece, partied with the Portuguese people on the Feast of St Anthony, spray painted the John Lennon wall and much more! I could continue to describe my experiences but this would become an essay worthy of a thesis presentation.
				<br><br>
				The best experience I have had while on this exchange is meeting the other exchange students in Essex. I have met so many amazing people from all around the world. I believe this is because we all think alike in some way. Most of us on student exchange seeked out this opportunity, showing a willingness for adventure, challenges, and the unknown. I believe most people who do student exchange are open-minded, who are optimistic towards everything they do in life. We are all culturally different, come from completely different time zones, and have different type of pigments. I made such a diverse and unique group of friends, who I will never forget. I know that whenever I’m in their city, I have a place to stay because of the relationships I’ve made.
				<br><br>
				University has been the best years of my life so far! First year, I lived in a student residence where I had a fantastic time making unforgettable memories and got to experience not being dependent on my parents for the first time. Second year, I lived together with my friends and experienced my first few jobs in the program I am studying. This year I was able to move to a completely different continent and still continue to thrive. My family continues congratulating me on my success and my friends wish they lived the life I have had so far. I also now have a new group of lifelong friends around the world who think just like me. I WILL continue to thrive and succeed in the next few years. I will also do my best to do another exchange experience before I graduate.
				<br><br>
				This year was also a fantastic year in terms of my stock investments. With the money I was making and reinvesting this year, my current stock portfolio is valued at $5,000, which might not seem that impressive but I have been able to use these earnings to cover my student debts and pay for my international exchange, which is a tremendous feeling.
				<br><br>
				I am really happy how this year went and what I achieved, as I managed to invest $5,000, secure experience in tech-related jobs, and I also had a very fun year as I have gone camping, skydiving, and partying with friends which might not seem like a professional accomplishment but my main goal in life is to enjoy it, so I’m entering the next year of my life with a great attitude and the drive to achieve my ambitious new goals.
				<br><br>
				During the last year, I accomplished so much that it seems almost impossible to find greater success this year. I was able to accomplish so much because I set smart short-term and long-term goals for myself. The reason I create short-term goals is because I use them as checkpoints in order to reach my long- term goals. Here is a list of my long-term goals and how I am going to fulfill these achievements.
				<br><br>
				A long-term goal of mine is to improve my personal blog, through using more organized posting and new high-quality content, so that my following increases. I plan on making it better by splitting my monthly post into two different posts in order to make it more convenient and accessible for my followers. I also want to add videos of my experiences to my blog whenever I have the opportunity; this is another reason why I bought an action camera.
				<br><br>
				My most important long-term goal is to acquire three different assets in order to make passive income. This is because I do not want to rely on a day job as my sole source of income for the rest of my life. I plan to start making passive income from my blog, by adding ads of the books I read about the stock market like Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. The reason I don’t currently have ads is because my current blog is actually just an extension of my biographical website josealba.org. I just bought a domain and pointed that domain to the extension of my website that contains my blog. This is why whenever you change pages the URL does not change. The reason I have not done this yet is because I don’t know if I want to rent another server to run my website. Another way I plan on making passive income is by investing in dividend stocks. I also want to make money from YouTube by adding my videos but this will be very hard so it will most likely be a different way.
				<br><br>
				Another goal of mine is to develop apps for iPhone or Android smartphones. I want to do this as I study Computer Science, but have almost no knowledge of app development. By developing apps it will develop valuable new skills to add to my CV and I think it would be a project I would enjoy to work on. My friend and I, have also been brainstorming on an app and we will begin developing it starting September 2017.
				<br><br>
				Even though I have these short and long term goals, I will still accomplish my biggest goal which is to enjoy life. I am 21 now and plan on enjoying my youth to its maximum. I am looking into some internships opportunities around the world that way I can travel and continue my professional career simultaneously. I know I have lots of potential and in order to continue thriving in my career, I have to continue working hard. This is why I have promised myself to not consume any alcohol until I get my next internship/co-op.
